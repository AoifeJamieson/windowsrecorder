# windowsrecorder
A simple CLI screen recorder for Windows.

At the moment the application just records 5 seconds of the screen using the Desktop Duplication API and Media Foundation and outputs an .mp4 video file in the application root directory!

Don't forget to set SUBSYSTEM to WINDOWS in Visual Studio to compile this application.
